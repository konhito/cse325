I only know these topics give a simple program
CO1 :: gain a comprehensive introduction to the Linux operating system, including basic
commands, system calls, and file management operations, enabling them to work effectively in a
Linux environment.
CO2 :: develop skills in shell programming, including handling variables, standard input/output
redirection, shell arithmetic, and flow control, enhancing their ability to write efficient shell
scripts.
CO3 :: perform file and directory management using system calls, allowing them to manipulate
files, directories, and their attributes programmatically.
CO4 :: gain hands-on experience in implementing and managing threads and concurrency
mechanisms.
CO5 :: demonstrate the ability to implement and use synchronization mechanisms such as
semaphores and mutexes.
CO6 :: use inter-process communication techniques such as pipes, popen, pclose, shared
memory and message passing to facilitate data exchange and synchronization between
processes.
Through this course students should be able to
Process creation and threading
• Creating processes
• Creating Threads
• Process duplication using fork()
• Creating threads using pthread
• Environment variables
• Replacing process image using execlp
Inter-process communication
• Pipes, popen and pclose functions
• Stream pipes, passing file descriptors
• Shared memory
• Message passing
• Remote Procedure calls
Introduction to Linux
• Basic Linux Commands: ls, cat, man, cd, touch, cp, mv, rmdir, mkdir, rm, chmod, pwd
• System Calls: Read, Write, Open
• Lseek
Synchronization
• Synchronization with Mutexes
• Synchronization with semaphores
• Race Condition
shell programming
• variables
